# ChromaticAberration

Chromatic aberrations are a common and challenging issue in the field of optics. These aberrations can lead to distorted and blurred images, reducing the quality of the final output. In order to address this issue, we propose a simulation-based game that utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the setup of optical devices, with the aim of minimizing chromatic aberrations in the generated image.

The simulation-based game allows for various factors to be changed, including the type of lenses, the number of lenses, their configurations, and focal lengths. By training an AI agent to play the game and learn through trial and error, an optimized lens configuration can be developed that minimizes chromatic aberrations. This optimized configuration can provide valuable insights into the most effective lens types, an optimum number of lenses, and efficient focal lengths for minimizing chromatic aberrations. 

The data collected from the game will be analyzed using statistical methods such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and visualization. These analyses will enable a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of chromatic aberrations, and how different lens configurations can affect them.

The expected outcomes of this research are an optimized lens configuration for reducing chromatic aberrations, an improved understanding of the physics of chromatic aberrations, validation of simulation-based methods, and publication of the results in academic journals and conferences. This research has the potential to contribute to the development of improved optical devices with minimized chromatic aberrations and to advance the field of simulation-based optimization and reinforcement learning.


## Tiny Ray Tracer C++
My First step was to follow the tinyRayTracer GitHub Repository and recreate the same results in C++. Here is the link to my GitHub repo where I worked on it.

## Tiny Ray Tracer Python
As the rest of my project is going to be on Python, that is why I recreated the tinyRayTracer above in Python. I have included the link below
